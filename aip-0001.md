# Introducing AIPs
* AIP: 1

## Abstract
An AIP is a design document that describes changes to the anetaBTC protocol. It should describe sophisticated ideas for new features, standards or processes in a technical and concise way and serve as a guideline for the anetaBTC community. AIP-0001 is intended to describe the function of AIPs, explain the process of AIPs and specify how AIPs should be structured and proposed. 

The team of anetaBTC expects AIPs to be the primary source for proposing new features by directly interacting with the community.

## Motivation
AIPs should give the community the opportunity to participate directly in the development of anetaBTC and discuss crucial points in the development. This gives the community the opportunity to propose changes to the protocol or additional features in a technical and detailed way. Furthermore, this repository can be used for discussions of future implementations. AIPs are solely for changes, enhancements and notices regarding the protocol. If changes are not related to the protocol itself but to governance, e.g. changes to how the Liquidity Fund is managed, the [anetaBTC Governance Proposals (AGP)](agp-0001.md) page should be visited.

## Specification
### Structure
An AIP should be as short as possible and as long as necessary. 
Each AIP should include the following parts: 
| Title | Description |
| ---  | ---  | 
| Header | Includes AIP number, Authors, Status, Type and the date of creation |
| Abstract | A short description of the proposed AIP |
| Motivation| Describes the issue that this AIP will fix or what it adds to the protocol. Why should this AIP be implemented? |
| Specification | Includes a detailed, solution-oriented description of the AIP. Depending on the type of the AIP it should include solutions by providing code. |
| Conclusions | Describes design decisions and should include points, which were discussed by the community.  |

### AIP Types
AIPs can be divided into three categories:
| Type | Description |
| ---  | ---  | 
| Standards | Describes changes to the core protocol of anetaBTC that involve major changes that can have a problematic impact on other parts of the protocol. |
| Process | Describes changes that do not require changes to the core protocol. These can be changes to tools or the environment (wallets, dapps, ...). |
| Informational | Does not describe any changes to the protocol but can indicate problems with the current version of the protocol or serve as general information for the community. |

### Workflow
An AIP begins with a proposal or an idea of one or multiple community members. At this stage, the AIP is viewed as a draft and serves to stimulate discussion with other interested community members in the AIP discussion channel in Discord. Once the discussions have settled and a fleshed-out version of the proposal emerges, it can be officially proposed as an AIP. It is essential that all feedback that is considered useful is incorporated into the proposal. Once an AIP is officially proposed (in form of a pull-request to this repository), it is reviewed by editors. After processing by the editor, the proposal can either be rejected, further changes may be objected, or the AIP can be set to active, which means that the changes will be implemented. 
## Conclusions
AIPs will be an impactful part of the future of anetaBTC and encourage community involvement. Every idea should be considered, and the community should be encouraged to participate in future developments.
