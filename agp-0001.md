# Introducing AGPs
* AGP: 1

## Abstract
An AGP is a document that includes a concrete proposal to change or expand the current governance of a certain part of the anetaBTC ecosystem. Furthermore, it should also be able to serve as a guideline for the community. AGP-0001 is intended to describe the function of AGPs, explain the process of AGPs and specify how AGPs should be structured and proposed. 

The team of anetaBTC expects AGPs to be the primary source for proposing changes to the governance of the anetaBTC protocol. 

## Motivation
AGPs should offer every member of the community the opportunity to have a say in how governance is managed in anetaBTC and to start discussions about new proposals or ways of management. AGPs should allow anyone to bring a proposal that may be voted on by holders of cNeta and Neta. For example, an AGP might be a proposal to change the use of the Liquidity Fund or how emissions to token holders should be done. This could then be brought to a vote provided a concrete proposal is made. 

AGPs are designed to make a governance proposal only. If changes to the core protocol or associated tools are required, the [anetaBTC Improvement Proposals (AIPs)](aip-0001.md) page should be visited.

## Specification
### Structure
An AGP should be as short as possible and as long as necessary. 
Each AGP should include the following parts: 
| Title | Description |
| ---  | ---  | 
| Header | Includes AGP number, Authors, Status, Type and the date of creation |
| Abstract | A short description of the proposed AGP |
| Motivation| Describes the changes the AGP proposes. What should be achieved through this change or extension? |
| Specification | Includes a detailed description of the AGP preferably with calculations and graphs if they benefit the understanding. |
| Conclusions | Closes the proposal with a short description how these changes will benefit each group and describes how decisions were made. Furthermore, community discussions and their results should be mentioned here. |

### AGP Types
AGPs can be divided into three categories:
| Type | Description |
| ---  | ---  | 
| Change | Changes describe modifications of the current setting of the ecosystem. For example, how emissions of the Liquidity Fund should work in the future. |
| Addition | Additions describe proposals for additional infrastructure which are part of or tools of governance. |
| Informational | These AGPs don't propose a change or an addition of the current system and are merely used to inform about a part of the system. They should act as guideline to the community. |


### Workflow
An AGP begins with a proposal or an idea of one or multiple community members. At this stage, the AGP is viewed as a draft and serves to stimulate discussion with other interested community members in the AGP discussion channel in Discord. Once the discussions have settled and a fleshed-out version of the proposal emerges, it can be officially proposed as an AGP. It is essential that all feedback that is considered useful is incorporated into the proposal. Once an AGP is officially proposed (in form of a pull-request to this repository), it is open to collect "signatures" by community members. Signatures can be collected during preliminary rounds of voting and determine which proposals will be voted on. Once enough cNeta and Neta holders signed the proposal, it will be included in the next voting round. Proposals that have collected too few signatures will be rejected but can try again in later voting rounds.
### AGP Status
AGPs will change their status depending on where in the process they are currently staying. 
| Type | Description |
| ---  | ---  | 
| Draft | This proposal is still discussed by the community |
| Ready| This proposal is ready to collect signatures in the next signature round. |
| Collecting | This proposal is currently collecting signatures. |
| Voting | This proposal is currently being voted on or will be listed in the next voting session. |
| Accepted | This proposal was voted on and it got accepted by the community. |
| Rejected | This proposal was voted on and it got rejected by the community. |

## Conclusions
AGPs will be an impactful part of the future of anetaBTC and encourage community involvement. Every idea should be considered, and the community should be encouraged to participate in the future of anetaBTC.
